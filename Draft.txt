Pathuri Bhavani

      Currently I am pursuing my Masters in Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri state University and I should be graduating by the end of 2020, I am from Guntur, India.
	  
	  
	  "Time and Tide wait for no man" , this we all know. Hence, having done an inspiring four-year course in Electronics and Communication engineering in KL University, I would like to put to use this knowledge to do my masters in Computer Science.This would give me the leading edge in technology and practical low-down and information.
	  
	   I want to be a database administrator and the course work here at northwest helps me to achieve my dream job.
	   
	   I am a hyperactive student where i can grap things fast
